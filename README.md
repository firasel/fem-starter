<h1 style="text-align:center">Frontend Mentor Starter Template with Storybook</h1>

Welcome to the Frontend Mentor (FEM) starter template. This template combines Next.js with Storybook integration.

## Commit Message Prefixes
For smooth version control, consider using these commit message prefixes:

- `feat` – when incorporating new features
- `fix` – addressing and resolving bugs
- `chore` – non-feature/fix changes (e.g., dependency updates)
- `refactor` – code improvements without bug fixes or new features
- `docs` – updates to project documentation
- `style` – changes related to code styling and formatting
- `perf` – optimizations for improved performance
- `ci` – configurations related to continuous integration
- `build` – changes affecting the build system or external dependencies
- `revert` – reverting a previous commit

## Frontend Guidelines
Simplicity is key:

- Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
- Prioritize responsive and accessible designs.
- Rigorously test your components to ensure they align with the unique requirements of each FEM challenge.

With this FEM starter template and Storybook integration, you're well-prepared to tackle any Frontend Mentor challenge with confidence. Happy coding!
